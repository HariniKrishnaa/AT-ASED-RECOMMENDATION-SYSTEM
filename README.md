DESCRIPTION : The primary goal of this project was to implement a scalable recommendation system that analyzes user preferences and suggests relevant products or content. Apache Mahout, a robust machine-learning library, was used to build collaborative filtering models for making intelligent recommendations.

Technology Stack:

Programming Language: Java

Libraries and Tools: Apache Mahout, Apache Hadoop (if required for large datasets), Maven (for dependency management)

Database: CSV files, MySQL, or any structured dataset

Development Environment: Visual Studio Code, Eclipse, or IntelliJ IDEA


Methodology: The project followed a structured approach to developing the recommendation system:

1. Data Collection:

A dataset of user interactions (e.g., product purchases, movie ratings) was used.

The dataset was formatted into user-item interaction records.



2. Data Preprocessing:

The data was cleaned and formatted into a structure compatible with Apache Mahout.

Duplicates and inconsistencies were removed to enhance accuracy.



3. Implementation of Recommendation Algorithm:

Collaborative Filtering was chosen as the primary approach:

User-Based Filtering: Finds similar users and suggests items based on their preferences.

Item-Based Filtering: Recommends items that are similar to those a user has already engaged with.


Apache Mahoutâ€™s recommender framework was used to implement these models efficiently.



4. Model Training and Evaluation:

The system was trained using historical user interaction data.

Evaluation was performed using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) and precision-recall to determine recommendation accuracy.



5. Deployment and Testing:

The model was integrated into a Java application with a simple UI or API.

The system was tested with different user inputs to validate recommendations.
